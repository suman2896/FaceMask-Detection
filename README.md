# FaceMask-Detection
This repository implements a robust face mask detection system using PyTorch with MobileNetV2 architecture. The model classifies images into two categories: with_mask and without_mask. The implementation includes complete training pipeline with data augmentation, automatic train-validation split, and comprehensive evaluation metrics.
